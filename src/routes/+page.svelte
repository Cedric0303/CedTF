<h3><u>First thing first, what is a CTF?</u></h3>
<p>
	Capture the Flag (CTF) in computer security is an exercise in which participants attempt to find
	text strings, called "flags", which are secretly hidden in purposefully-vulnerable programs or
	websites. They can be used for both competitive or educational purposes.
</p>
<br />
<h3><u>How to identify flags?</u></h3>
<p>The flags have a specific format ‚Üí <b>FLAG: {'{'}sequence of characters{'}'}</b></p>
<br />
<p>
	Try and find all the flags üè≥Ô∏è on this website, good luck! <small>(there are 5 in total)</small>
